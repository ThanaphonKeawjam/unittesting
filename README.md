#### Problem 1: Count Distinct Elements in a List

> Count the number of distinct elements in a list.
> The list may be empty but not null.

#### Problem 2: Binary Search

> Use Binary Search algorithm search element in an array that already sorted.
> Binary Search compare the target value to middle element of the array.
> If they are not equal, this half will eliminated and search continues on the another half until they find index of the matching element and return it.
> If the value to find is null, throw an exception.

Write JUnit test for test two problems above.
